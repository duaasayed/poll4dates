            you are who you claim to be. For this purpose, we require that you
            verify ownership of your e-mail address.</p>

            <p>We have sent an e-mail to you for verification. Please click on the link inside that 
            e-mail. If you do not see the verification e-mail in your main inbox, check your spam folder. 
            Otherwise contact us if you do not receive it within a few minutes.</p>
